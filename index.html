            <h1>SkyStars</h1>
            <p>A star is an astronomical object comprising a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its gravity.
                 The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, 
                 but their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points of light. 
                 The most prominent stars have been categorised into constellations and asterisms,
                 and many of the brightest stars have proper names. </p>
